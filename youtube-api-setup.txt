# YouTube API Setup Instructions

1. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project
2. Add the following line to the file:
   ```
   VITE_YT_API_KEY=your_actual_youtube_api_key
   ```
3. Replace "your_actual_youtube_api_key" with your real YouTube Data API key
4. Save the file and restart your development server with `npm run dev`

Note: Make sure the .env file is included in your .gitignore to keep your API key private
